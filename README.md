# A simple app for the Angular PWA Workshop

## Prerequisites
1. Latest stable versions of `node`, `npm` installed.
2. Static web server with SPA support:
- [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve). Recommended and pre-configured.
- [superstatic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superstatic). Use this as a fallback option.

## Install
1. Clone the repo
2. 
```bash
git checkout workbox-v4
npm install
```

## Install/update Angular CLI
```bash
npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

Check the version:
```bash
npm list @angular/cli version -g
```
The output should be at least `6.x.x`

## Checking the app
1. In the terminal
```bash
ng serve
```
2. Open [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). You should see the page with `Angular PWA` header.
3. "Ctrl-C" to stop the app.

## Creating a production build and serving it via external web server
```bash
